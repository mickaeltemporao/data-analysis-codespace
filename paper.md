# Introduction
Provide an brief overview of the research topic and its significance. Clearly state the research question and your hypothesis that your study aims to address. 

> $H_1$: My hypothesis description

Include any necessary background information and the objectives of the study. What has been done, and the current limitiations. 

Do not forget to include relevant sources in the `references.bib` file.

- All **sources are leveraged** and put in perspective in the document.
- Use in-text citations by using citation keys from the `references.bib` file, such as `[@brady1995beyond]` for parenthetical citations or `@brady1995beyond illustrate that...` for narrative citations.

Here is an illustration: Recent studies have explored the intersection of gender and political engagement, highlighting significant findings. For instance, @dassonneville2018gender argue that gender influences voting behavior, particularly in how candidates are perceived. Similarly, the role of social networks in political participation cannot be overstated as access to resources significantly impacts political involvement [@brady1995beyond].

## Writing Tip
- **1 page** = ~5 paragraphs
- **1 paragraph** =  ~5 sentences = 1 idea
    - The first sentence in a paragraph introduces the idea.
    - Followed by three sentences written has arguments supporting the idea.
    - The last sentence concludes the idea.
- **1 sentence ** = ~20 words
- Your final paper is less than **4000 words.**
